Displays an event calendar with events from Eventoni.de, a constantly updated search engine for events in Germany.

== Description ==

Show your users interesting and highly relevant events from Eventoni.de, a constantly updated search engine for events in Germany.

You can configure the plugin to show events near the user, near a location you specify and/or restrict your display to certain topics (to match your site's audience).

If you enter events to the Eventoni database yourself, you can also limit the plugin to these events, combining a nice-looking calendar widget for your events with the added traffic from Eventoni.de, which disseminates your events to Facebook, the VZ network and participating blogs, homepages etc.

Additional Features:
* When editing posts, show events relevant to your post and add them dynamically to your blog post
* Integrate events from eventoni.de Event search into your blog search
